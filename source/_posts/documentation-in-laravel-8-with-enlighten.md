The importance of software documentation, even in an agile world, is undisputed. Keeping documentation, especially for 
APIs, up-to-date however can be an additional burden on a development team, and thus automatically generated 
documentation can help supplement this by producing reference materials. This is where Enlighten comes in.

In this guide, we'll get Laravel Enlighten up-and-running, which utilises your existing PHPUnit tests 
(because you _should_ be writing tests) to produce and publish beautiful, customisable documentation, without needing to
run any additional commands.

## System Requirements

Enlighten **does** require both PHP 7.4 and Laravel 8. I don't know whether it works with Lumen. If you're running 
anything earlier, such as Laravel 6 LTS, I would instead recommend [Scribe](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe). For 
other frameworks or vanilla PHP applications, try [phpDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org/).

You will also need a secondary database. It does not need to be a different _kind_ of database, but it does need to be 
persistent.

You also need an up-to-date version of Git. This is unlikely to be a problem on macOS, Linux or Windows Subsystem for 
Linux, but it gave me some teething problems directly running on Windows 10 under Laragon.

Please also note that these are as simple installation instructions as possible. For troubleshooting and optional 
installation steps, please check the [project's repository](https://github.com/StydeNet/enlighten).

## Installation

### Composer installation

**Do not use `sudo` for any of these commands. That will open a whole Pandora's box you don't want to deal with.**

Using Composer, require Enlighten into your Laravel project using the following command. If you somehow don't have it, 
grab it [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

```bash
composer require styde/enlighten --dev
```

### Registering the service provider

Next, add the following to your `config/app.php` file in order to register Enlighten's service provider. If you're not 
sure where this needs to go, put it underneath the _package service providers_ comment, like thus:

```php
[
  'providers' => [
    // ...
    /*
     * Package Service Providers...
     */
     Styde\Enlighten\Providers\EnlightenServiceProvider::class,
    // ...
  ]
];
```

**Important:** _Be sure to end the line in a comma, not a semicolon._

### Publish assets to the public directory

Run the following command to publish Enlighten's assets to your `public` directory. Without this, any documents you 
generate will lack any CSS formatting or JavaScript.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enlighten-build
```

### Integrating Enlighten into your tests

In order for Enlighten to activate during testing and to have access to test data, it will need to be imported and 
initialised during the setup phase of your tests. You can do this in your `TestCase.php` abstract class, or in 
individual test files.

For example:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase as BaseTestCase;
use Styde\Enlighten\Tests\EnlightenSetup; // import this trait

abstract class TestCase extends BaseTestCase
{
  use CreatesApplication;
  use EnlightenSetup; // and use said trait here

  protected function setUp(): void
  {
    parent::setUp();

    $this->setUpEnlighten(); // the final piece of the puzzle
  }
}
```

**Important:** _I believe you need to still call `parent::setUp()` in your `setUp()` methods within your tests._

### Setting up the secondary database

As aforementioned, Enlighten needs another database to record information. The easiest way to do this is to create 
another database with the same name of your existing one, except with an `_enlighten` suffix.

For example, if you have used a MySQL database named `laravel`, you can create another one called `laravel_enlighten` 
which will be used automatically. This assumes you're using the same database connection, credentials, and driver.

Once you've made it, run your migrations to get it set up:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

The next optional section is for you should you need a different configuration.

### Optional: Custom database setup

If you need to use something else, add a new entry to your `config/database.php` file with the name `enlighten`. This 
can support a different driver, credentials, database name, etc. You can add this information as custom entries in 
your `.env` file - possibly with an `_ENLIGHTEN` suffix for clarity.

For example:

```php
'enlighten' => [
  'driver' => 'mysql',
  'host' => env('DB_HOST_ENLIGHTEN', '127.0.0.1')
  'port' => env('DB_PORT_ENLIGHTEN', '3306')
  'database' => env('DB_DATABASE_ENLIGHTEN', 'laravel_enlighten')
  'username' => env('DB_USERNAME_ENLIGHTEN', 'root')
  'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD_ENLIGHTEN', '')
// â€¦
],
```

I think that you could use an SQLite database in theory, but I haven't tested this and generally stick to the defaults.

Don't forget to run your migrations if you chose this route.

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Running Enlighten

Once you've set everything up, Enlighten will run when you run your test suite:

```bash
php artisan test
```

You can then find your new documentation at the `yourwebsite.test/enlighten/` URL.

Here you can quickly see at a glance what feature and unit tests have passed or failed. Navigating to individual tests 
can show you more information, including headers, responses, and a screenshot of what was returned if it were HTML.

(_This is just an example API project with very basic tests._)

## What's next?

This guide was designed to get Enlighten up-and-running as easily as possible. More customisation and configuration 
options are available to make your documentation as detailed and organised as possible. You can read more on the
[project's repository](https://github.com/StydeNet/enlighten).

I hope that you've found this guide useful and I encourage you to check it out with your Laravel API projects! It goes 
without saying, but Enlighten wasn't written by me - it's an open source project headed by Duilio Palacios and Jeff 
Ochoa.

Thank you so much for reading.
