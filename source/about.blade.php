  <h1>About</h1>

  <h2 class="mb-2">By day</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I currently work as a full-stack web developer at
    <a href="https://www.stickeetechnology.com" target="_blank">Stickee Technology</a>, the titanium arm of the company
    that builds the special projects that our big data clients need to thrive. There emerged my serious interest
    in building future-proof, inordinately tested, high performance experiences on the web and beyond, as well as
    maintaining and supporting many of our open source initiatives.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mb-2">By night</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Mental health awareness and suicide intervention are causes close to my heart and as such I am a senior member of
    the <a href="https://www.nightline.ac.uk" target="_blank">Nightline Association</a>'s software development team;
    composed entirely of volunteers. Providing the technology needed to ensure students across the country have
    someone to talk in an anonymous, judgement-free environment.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-6">
    After being severely unwell with COVID-19, I began work on
    <a href="https://www.github.com/extracontinue" target="_blank">ExtraContinue</a>, a website and app to help you
    organise messages and events should the unforeseeable occur. I’m hoping to have a working release by the end of the
    year.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Lastly, I’m hoping to some day release numerous video games written in Godot under my indie game studio,
    <a href="https://www.petrobolos.com" target="_blank">Petrobolos</a>. Emphasis on <em>some day</em>!
  </p>

  <h2 class="mb-2">Still curious?</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    If you still want to learn more about my work, or are interested in hiring me, I'd love it if you could reach out
    to me over on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliverearl" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. Thanks so much!
